ROUTING

WHAT IS A ROUTER?
a router directs internet traffic

IMPLEMENTATION

[WARNING!: the following information may be wrong or misrepresentitive of what we actually need to do]

a router has two tables: 
1) An ARP table (needed? Is this handled by another protocal?) 
2) a Routing table


ARP table:
allows router to translate ip into mac address
this table is updated when packets are sent through the router much like a switch

Routing table: 
lets the router know where to send the next packet
this table is NOT updated as packets are sent and is instead updated by

a) talking to other routers on the network. The way routers update routing information is determined by various routing protocols.
This update is done periodicly (or maybe when adjacent nodes are updated?). In our first implementation routers will be only static ip. 

b) an admin manually adding routes

c) adding adjacent nodes to routing table


when a packet with an address that is not on the routing table is recieved by the router
the router will discard the packet. This means the routing table must be initialized before communication can occur.
a


start -> the routing table should be populated before the simulation starts so it probably will 

recieve -> the user process will give the router a message. the router will then put the message through the routing table
and send it to the correct tap

ROADMAP:
0.) implement structs needed for routing table like mask
1.) implement a routing table
2.) implement a router with static routing
3.) implement functionality for configuring a routing table using the ndl
4.) implement a router with distance-vector routing

5.) implement a router using a link-state routing protocol                          -| are these the same?
6.) implement interior gateway protocols combined with exterior gateway protocal    -|

QUESTIONS?
-how does NAT (Network address translation) fit into routing
will our networks be big enough to need this?

-should static routers still be populated with adjacent network nodes at first?
