ROUTING

WHAT IS A ROUTER?
a router directs internet traffic

IMPLEMENTATION
a router has two tables: An ARP table and a Routing table

ARP table:
allows router to translate ip into mac address
this table is updated when packets are sent through the router much like a switch

Routing table: 
lets the router know where to send the next packet
this table is NOT updated as packets are sent and is instead updated by
a) talking to other routers on the network. The way routers update routing information is determined routing protocols.
b) an admin manually adding routes
c) 

when a packet with an address that is not on the routing table is recieved by the router
the router will discard the packet. This means the routing table must be initialized before communication can occur.
